<!-- Your indenting is still a bit wonky. It seems like a small issue, but getting the formatting right in your html is the firszt step toward building a kick ass program. If your formatting's off, the rest of your program will probably be off as well. Before you start anything with JavaScript, make sure your HTML is cleanly written and well formatted (<html>, <head>, and <body> tags all flush with the back wall of your program. Everything else indented; Check for any missing closing tags; When writing empty divs, their opening and closing tags should be on the same line.) These changes will save you hours of headachs when you're debugging your code later. Cleanliness is step one on the road to awesome-ness. -->
